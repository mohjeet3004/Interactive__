            <p>Subtle in flavor, spinach is anything but when it comes to nutrition. "The most nutritious salad greens
                are generally the darkest in color," Kennedy says. And the deep, vibrant color of spinach hints at its
                nutritional profile: 1 cup has 16 percent of your daily requirement of vitamin A, and all your daily
                vitamin K, according to the USDA. When spinach is cooked, itâ€™s an excellent source of iron (more than
                one-third of your daily requirement), as well as vitamin C (20 percent of your daily requirement) and
                fiber, which is essential for digestive health, per the USDA. Cooked spinach also contains more folate
                than most salad greens, according to Kennedy, which helps convert the food you eat into energy and
                produces healthy red and white blood cells, according to the National Institutes of Health. Pair spinach
                with strawberries, balsamic, and a sprinkle of feta cheese for a flavor-packed salad.</p>
